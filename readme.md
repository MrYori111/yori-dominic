## Python Programming Review

Clone this repository to your own account before working on the problems within each file. Do not push any changes directly to this repository.

- ps01.py **Python with Intentional Errors**. Fix the issues in this code to get the correct output!
- ps02.py **Area of Traingle**. Create a Python program that computes the area of a triangle using Heron's Formula. Instead of using the sqrt() function from the math module, use exponentiation to calculate the square root.
- ps03.py **Conditional Statements**. Refactor the code:
  - For line 18-21, use ternary conditional operator.
  - For line 35-45, instead of using match case, apply a standard if-elif-else structure.
  - To improve readability add section headers (=== Section Name ===) to make each part of the program distinct.
- ps04.py **Loop, Conditional Statements**.
  - Identify and eliminate code redundancy: Refactor the existing code by creating a dedicated function to handle specific logic.
  - Generate random numbers: Employ the random module to generate two random integers within a suitable range for multiplication problems.
  - Implement "Try Again" functionality:
    - When the player chooses to try again:
      - Do not reset the player's scores.
      - Continue incrementing the count of attempted questions.There's a redundancy in the code, improve this by utilizing function.
  - Present a summary of the game results to the user:
    - Display a list of correctly answered questions.
    - Display a list of incorrectly answered questions.
